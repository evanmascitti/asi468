# asi468

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package houses data objects and other functions used commonly in
ASI 468l. This includes tared water content tins, beakers, flasks, etc.

It is mean to compliment the other packages I have written for use in
the lab, namely **soilmesh** and the soon-to-be-renamed **diRtscience**.
